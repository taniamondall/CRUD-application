# CRUD-application
So I have created a crud application using PHP . You can edit ,delete and add note.
You have to install one of the mysql server like xampp or wampp.
Then you have to start the server .
The next step is to create a database named 'notes'.
Then you can import my table to your database you have to name the table notes
Then create a php file and add it to ht doc folder.
